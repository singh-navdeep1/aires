          <h2>IN THE WEEKS UP TO YOUR MOVE</h2>
          <p>
            It is important to start thinking about the things that need to be done before you move. You may be looking for a place to start when packing for your new home. You should declutter your home in the weeks before you move. You could consider moving your home a great way of freshening up your life, getting rid of old belongings, or just clearing up space.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moving homes can be expensive. Removalists often charge you based on how many people are involved. This means that you could save money by letting some items go. To save space, empty your refrigerator and pantry before you leave.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your move will be quicker if you have fewer things to move. While you’re going through your belongings, make sure to prepare your home for the removalists. Take note of any items that require special care during transport. You will be able to prepare a list for your move consultant so that you don’t miss anything.
          </p>
          <p class="show_desktop">
            If you’re moving to another area where you will need to find a new doctor, and have chosen to opt out of the My Health Record you should contact your current physician to transfer your records to your new practice.

          <summary> Why story ideas matter?</summary>
          <div class="faq__content">
            <p>A PR agency mostly depends on two things: relationship with the journalists and creative story ideas. If the relationship with the journalist is strong but story is not interesting, it will not formulate into coverage. The most important point to keep in mind is that getting placed is not the sole purpose of the company. Being able to reach out to the target audience while creating an impact amongst them is also important which can be achieved through the story ideas. Journalists are a medium of reaching to the target groups, but instilling the recalling value in them and ensuring their loyalty can be done through story ideas.
