          <summary> Why story ideas matter?</summary>
          <div class="faq__content">
            <p>A PR agency mostly depends on two things: relationship with the journalists and creative story ideas. If the relationship with the journalist is strong but story is not interesting, it will not formulate into coverage. The most important point to keep in mind is that getting placed is not the sole purpose of the company. Being able to reach out to the target audience while creating an impact amongst them is also important which can be achieved through the story ideas. Journalists are a medium of reaching to the target groups, but instilling the recalling value in them and ensuring their loyalty can be done through story ideas.

          <div class="faq__content">
            <p>No. One can never trust social media blindly when it comes to public relations. Although, brands benefit a lot from social media.

Otherwise, it may result negatively for your firm.</p>
